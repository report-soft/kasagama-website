        <h3 class="title-about">Our Curriculum</h3><br>
        <p class="about">At Kasagama Secondary School, we are dedicated to providing a dynamic and relevant academic experience for all our students. As a forward-thinking 
            institution, we have fully embraced the New Lower Secondary Curriculum implemented by the Ugandan Ministry of Education and Sports. This learner-centered 
            approach focuses on developing competencies, fostering critical thinking, and promoting holistic growth among our students.</p> <br>
        
        <p class="about">Our academic program for Senior 1 to Senior 4 is designed to equip students with the essential knowledge, skills, and values needed to thrive in 
            the 21st century. The New Curriculum emphasizes thematic learning, where subjects are integrated to provide a deeper and more meaningful understanding of 
            concepts. This approach encourages students to make connections across disciplines and apply their learning to real-world contexts.</p> <br>
